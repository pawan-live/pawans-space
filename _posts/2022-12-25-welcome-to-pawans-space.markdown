Hi all, Welcome to my blog! This would be my first post on this blog, which I managed to finally get up and running after procrastinating for so long 😆. Yeah, I always had this idea of starting a blog and hopefully, writing regularly, which I couldn't achieve (by the way, this isn't my first blog— I started several but could not continue due to various reasons). So hopefully this will be updated regularly, I mean, worst case, at least once a week 🤞.

### What to expect from this—

As you might know ([see about](https://blog.itspawanlive.me/about)), I'm a fan of travel, and exploration other than tech. (Yeah this is not going to be a developer blog 😆 like everyone does) I'll be sharing my experiences here, be it travel, exploring places, learning new things and whatnot. So If you stumbled upon this post by any means, you can regularly check this space for updates. Or else you can subscribe with your email below to get notified whenever I make a new post.

That's all peeps, have a nice day/night! 🎉
